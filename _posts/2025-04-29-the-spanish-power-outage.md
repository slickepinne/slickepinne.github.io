title: And Then There Was Darkness - Or Why Did Niklas Touch The Butter
categories: [Spain, Outage, Blackout]
---

Monday, April 28th. It started around 12:20 (UTC + 2) when one of my dogs started to get restless. She was walking around, yawning and was starting to make this noise that either means she needs to puke or well, something else that can get solved by taking her outside. So I took the leash and we went to the garden. Nothing. She was still kind of nervous when we went back inside. Niklas, my housemate, was standing in the kitchen at that time. Nearly time for our lunch break. It was 12:35 or something like that. I don't know why but he touched the butter and the light of the fridge turned off. He was joking that the butter turned off electricity. Funny.

## Gone? Gone!

I went to my home office to update my Slack status to say I'm out for lunch – nada. No internet. My external monitor stayed dark. Meanwhile, Niklas checked the fuse box – everything seemed normal. I opened Slack on my mobile but had zero reception. So it wasn't only electricity that was gone, mobile and phone connection were a thing of the past as well.

Now, I don't live in Spain only since yesterday – I'm used to some outages from time to time and usually they last around, what, maybe 15 minutes? The phone coverage was a bit weird, but it would be up soon. Funny. We prepared lunch but soon realised that it would be stuck in the preparation phase – can't cook or use the oven without electricity. Raw potatoes and burger, despite being plant based, are not my thing.
By that time, we thought that it's quite possible the outage will take _a bit_ longer. But somehow we had to reach our colleagues – we both had meetings planned. And because reception was affected as well it was rather unlikely that only our street had these issues. We took the car to drive to the next village. And to the next. And the next. Traffic lights didn't work, neither did the displays of petrol stations. It was chaos. Traffic jams, people honking, making wild gestures, stressing me out. I was so hungry. I asked Niklas why he touched the butter.
Suddenly, he got reception and I pulled over so I myself could send updates to my colleagues. My provider didn't work. We continued driving. Nothing. I tried to use Niklas' mobile as hotspot – it didn't let me connect. What the heck. He received the news that the whole Iberian peninsula was affected. Funny.

## An Ode to Vanlife

We drove home, I got a yoghurt from the fridge, thought about all the food that would turn to waste if this would take longer and worked on some task internet wasn't needed for. Internet didn't come back. Electricity neither. I started another task but soon reached a point at which I couldn't make more progress. The documentation is not available offline and although I always have a trillion browser tabs open, the correct one was missing. Funny.

Good preparation is everything and we were still unsure about the length of the outage – will access to water be next? Wouldn't be the first time. So we filled up 3 25l canisters of fresh water that I usually use in my converted transporter. Just in case. I asked myself why Niklas touched the butter and had the idea of writing this blog post. No internet needed. Time was passing and we felt the urge to get a coffee – but, haha, no electricity for the stove or coffee machine. I mentioned the van, right?! For a moment I had the idea to just pack it and drive somewhere – I'm able to work from the road. The effort would be too high though – I still believed that everything would be back to normal soon. (*Note: it's currently 17:20 (UTC+2) and no change*) But the thought of the van and outdoor activities in general let me remember that I have an outdoor gas stove – and with that the ability to make coffee. Day saved.

What's left now is waiting. And being thankful for the sun and therefore light which allows me to work from the terrace. If you asked yourself if Niklas touched the butter again. He did. Nothing happened.

**Update 21:15 (UTC+2)**: Power nor reception were back, so we used the gas stove once again to prepare the marinated potatoes and burger. Put some candles and camping lamps on the table and had a lovely dinner.

**Update ~23:00 (UTC+2)**: Still darkness but gosh, how amazing are stars that are not blended by city lights.

**Update ~01:30 (UTC+2)**: Power and reception came back. Woke up because fridge, oven and electric stove were so happy to be alive again that they started to scream.

**Update 09:00 (UTC+2, April 29th**: My colleagues were better informed than me about what had happened in Spain. I got a bit nervous when Ona (my dog) started to become restless aga...
