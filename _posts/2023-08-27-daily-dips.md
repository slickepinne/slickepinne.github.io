Jasmin Hortop is an amazing illustrator I follow on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jasminehortop/) – and if you don't follow her yet, please do it now. She lives in her van and has a cutie four legged fellow called Darla. And Daily Dips is something she did last year and started today; again. A daily dip into the sea. Over in the UK, it's much colder than it is for me in Spain, but still – it will be a challenge as I want to do my daily dip in the morning, before work.

### Day #1

It was quite windy, but warm – and we had waves which is quite unusual for Almería or let's call it rare. I didn't swim (_too scared_) but I count it as a dip.
