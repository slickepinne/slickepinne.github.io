categories: [Regular Expressions]
---

Since I am somehow passionate about regular expressions – and lots of developers out there not, I thought a "Regex Short Series" could be a great way to reduce scepticism.

### Facts, Facts, Facts

Before we begin to talk about regular expressions in detail, let's start this series with some factss

1. You read Regular Expressions **one by one** from **left to right**
2. You don't need to know a programming language to understand them
3. Learning them will boost your confidence

Although these facts might be obvious, they might be easy to forget. Don't.

See you soon.
