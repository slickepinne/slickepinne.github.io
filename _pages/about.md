🧚‍♀️
My name is Svenja. I live in Spain – more precisely in a village called "Villa de Otura" near Granada; I grew up in Dortmund (Germany), moved and travelled around a bit until I had enough of the sad weather and found my way to Andalusia.

👩‍💻
I'm a Development Team Lead at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com) which gives me the great opportunity to not only code with fantastic people but to also mentor wonderful folks.

🐾
Speaking about fantastic and wonderful – I have two incredible dogs, Hugo and Ona with whom I enjoy spending time with.

🌱
I'm trying to live a healthy and sustainable life which means that I don't kill or hurt animals: not for food nor clothes or dog food. Yeah, my dogs, as long as nothing unexpected happens, are plant eater as I am.

🛹
Recently, I had the thought that learning how to skateboard is a good idea – let's see how long that last.
